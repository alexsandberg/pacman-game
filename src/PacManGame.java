     * main() serves as the central method through which the flow of the program
     is directed and all other methods are integrated. This method accepts the
     initial user input for the dimensions of the PacMan grid, which is then
     passed to generateGrid() to generate the grid. main() also processes user
     input from the command menu and utilizes a switch to call the appropriate
     method, while using a do-while loop to ensure the validity of user input.
     *
     * Pre-conditions: java.util.Scanner has been imported
     *
     * Post-conditions: main() will accept user input for grid size and direct
     those inputs to the proper methods for creating a correctly sized game
     grid. main() will evaluate user input in the command menu and call the
     correct methods for executing the corresponding commands. main() will
     calculate the number of cookies for a given grid (12% of grid size). main()
     will print statistics at the end of the game.

     given time, then it replaces the current cell with an empty symbol (" "),
     then calculates the index value of the next cell over in the given
     direction, then replaces that cell with the same Pac-Man symbol (Pac-Man
     never turns). Finally, the updated gameArray is returned. Additionally, if
     the Pac-Man symbol is in a cell in the top or bottom row, or the far left
     or far right column, and the Pac-Man attempts to move in the direction of
     the game grid "wall", the Pac-Man will remain in place and will not "wrap

     position in whichever direction the Pac-Man symbol is facing, by first
     finding the present symbol and then correctly calculating the position that
     represents a move of one in the correct direction. If the Pac-Man is up
     against one of the edges of the grid and attempts to move towards the edge,

     * The generateGrid() method generates the initial gameplay grid following
     user input of size specifications. The size of the grid is calculated based
     on the user input dimensions (numX and numY), then 12% of the grid is
     randomly filled with cookie symbols ("O"), then the remaining grid cells
     are filled with ".", and finally a left-facing Pac-Man symbol is added in
     index position 0. This method is called at the beginning of the game and
     establishes the starting grid which will successively be updated throughout
     the game using other methods. This method ensures that 12% of the array
     cells are filled with cookies by adding an extra cookie at a new random
     index location any time a random number is called more than once.
     *
     * Pre-Conditions: int numX and int numY reflect the desired dimensions of
     the game grid as specified by user input.
     *
     * Post-Conditions: generateGrid() will generate and return an array with
     length as determined by user input values. The array will be filled with
     12% cookies (rounded down), a left-facing (">") Pac-Man symbol in the first
     array position (index 0), and all other cells filled with ".".
